VeraSynchronizedDimmer
==============

This is a app for Vera devices that will allow two or more dimmer switches to be synchronized. This will allow the dimmers to act like 3 way switches even though they are wired as completely separate devices.

This app is early in development, I recommend waiting to install it.
